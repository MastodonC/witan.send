# Mover

## Context

We need an agreed upon definition of what a "mover" transition is. 

## Decision

A mover is someone who has an EHCP but they have been moved between settings, either because they have aged out of their previous setting or if their requirements have changed. A mover for 2016 would be someone who between Jan-16 and Jan-17 changed setting within SEND.

In terms of data a mover would have a different starting setting (`setting-1`), from their ending setting (`setting-2`). It is possible for them to also have different needs. They would still require an applicable calendar year and academic years.

Need only changes are not currently included in the model, as they are deemed uncommon and would increase the number of rates calculated, in short making the subpopulations smaller and harder to project.

## Status

In review.

## Consequences

The calendar year being moved to is assumed, not specified (in the example above, this would be 2017).
