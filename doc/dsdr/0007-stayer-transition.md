# Stayer

## Context

We need an agreed upon definition of what a "stayer" is. 

## Decision

A stayer is someone who has an EHCP and has stayed in the same setting during their transition between calendar years. A stayer for 2016 would be someone who between Jan-16 and Jan-17 stayed in the same setting.

In terms of data a leaver would have the same setting for their starting (`setting-1`) and ending setting (`setting-2`). They are able to change need. They would still require an applicable calendar year and academic years.

Need only changes are not currently included in the model, as they are deemed uncommon and would increase the number of rates calculated, in short making the subpopulations smaller and harder to project.

## Status

In review.

## Consequences

The calendar year being moved to is assumed, not specified (in the example above, this would be 2017).
