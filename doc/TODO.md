  Query negative transition rates
  Query duplicate transitions

x Calculate non-send initial cohort
x Calculate non-send population growth
x Iteratively apply transition matrix
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
x  Update existing model to be deterministic and compare 1-year & 2-year projectsions without multiplier
  Make new model probabilistic
  Determine if population growth only applies to non-SEND
  Determine whether new population is applied before or after state transitions
  Determine whether state transition matrix applies to year before or after transition
  Determine if scenarios should be matched pairs of +ve and -ve changes
  Should we apply smoothing when generating the transition matrix?

  Calulate confidence intervals based on n simulations
  Adjust transition multiplier based on age

  Validate transition matrix contains all state transitions exactly once
  Validate transition matrix probabilities add up to 1.0
  Validate population projection contains all ages and years
