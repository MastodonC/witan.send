# Introduction to witan.send

This model allows English local authorities to compare the costs and demand for SEND (special educational needs and disabilities)  services for different future scenarios. The demand is for statements/EHC plans only and does not include SEN support. 

A stochastic Markov chain approach is used to assign a state to each individual eligible for SEND at each time step of the model. 

This flowchart shows the structure of the model:
